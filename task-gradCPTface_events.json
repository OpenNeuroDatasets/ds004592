    "TaskName": "Gradual-onset continuous performance task with face stimuli",
    "TaskDescription": "This is a processed output file. The experiment was run by Matlab and Psychtoolbox."
    "Levels": [
        "onset: the onset of the first trial is recorded",
        "duration: trial duration (1 s), a trial consists of transition (0.8 s) and intact (0.2 s) stimulus presentations",
        "trial_num: 500 trials in total",
        "target_nontarget: 1-nontarget (should respond), 2-target (should not respond)",
        "image_id: 11 unique faces in total, images 1-10 are nontarget faces and image 11 is a target face",
        "transition_duration: upon the onset of the trial, the stimulus from the previous trial gradually transitioned to the stimulus from the current trial in a linear pixel-by-pixel interpolation",
        "resp_1st: 1-button press recorded, 0-no button press recorded",
        "resp_2nd: 1-in case where two button presses are recorded in a trial",
        "rt_1st: response time of the 1st button press",
        "rt_2nd: response time of the 2nd button press",
        "acc: 1-hit and correct rejection, 0-false alarm and miss"
